# CNN Transfer Learning


The principle is easy: optimize and accelerate the learning of a model by training specific layers, transfer them to a deeper model and iterate.

[//]: # (The gradients are fully A kind of bottleneck effect forces the layers to )

That's the opportunity to better understand the building and training of models
This is relevant when the compute capacity gets insufficient compared to the needs.
Cloud GPUS are good but at some point beyond the budget...

## Context
Training a dog and cat recognizer over 10000 pictures. 8000 for training (+ data augmentation) and 2000 for testing
